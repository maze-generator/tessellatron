- Create a solvable graph representation of a 2D-maze with 90˚ branches.
- Ensure abstract model of the maze would fit within 2D space.
- Find the (shortest) solution of a given maze from a graph representation.
- Generate less or more branches of greater or lesser depths when first making the maze.
